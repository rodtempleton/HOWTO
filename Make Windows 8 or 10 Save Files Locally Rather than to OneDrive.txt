MAKE WINDOWS 8/10 SAVE FILES LOCALLY RATHER THAN TO ONEDRIVE
------------------------------------------------------------

WHENEVER YOU SAVE FILES ON A WINDOWS 8.1 OR WINDOWS 10 MACHINE, IF THE MACHINE IS LOGGED IN WITH A MICROSOFT ACCOUNT, IT WILL WANT TO SAVE FILES TO ONEDRIVE, RATHER THAN TO THE LOCAL MACHINE.  THIS IS PROBLEMATIC IN THE WINDOWS 8.1 LEVEL 1 COURSE WHICH INVOKES THE 'COPY TO' COMMAND.  THE USER IS TOLD TO COPY THE FILES TO 'DOCUMENTS', BUT IT ACTUALLY SAVES IN 'ONEDRIVE -> DOCUMENTS'.  

USING GPEDIT
============
HIT WIN+R TO BRING UP THE RUN COMMAND AND ENTER GPEDIT.MSC.  THIS WILL BRING UP THE LOCAL GROUP POLICY EDITOR
NAVIGATE TO Computer Configuration -> Admin Templates -> Windows Components -> OneDrive
LOCATE THE SETTING CALLED 'SAVE DOCUMENTS AND PICTURES TO ONEDRIVE BY DEFAULT' (WHICH SHOULD BE SHOWING AS 'NOT CONFIGURED').  
DOUBLE CLICK ON IT TO OPEN THE OPTIONS, CLICK ON DISABLED -> APPLY -> OK

CLOSE THE LOCAL GROUP POLICY EDITOR AND REBOOT TO MAKE THE CHANGES EFFECTIVE.


USING REGEDIT
=============
IF YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE GROUP POLICY EDITOR, YOU CAN USE REGEDIT:
HIT WIN+R TO BRING UP THE RUN COMMAND AND ENTER REGEDIT.  THIS WILL BRING UP THE REGISTRY EDITOR
NAVIGATE TO:
	HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Onedrive

IN THE RIGHT HAND PANE, RIGHT-CLICK AND SELECT NEW -> DWORD VALUE.  NAME THE NEWLY CREATED DWORD AS: DisableLibrariesDefaultToSkyDrive.  DOUBLE CLICK ON THIS NEW DWORD
INPUT THE VALUE DATA AS  '1'.  CLICK OK

CLOSE THE REGISTRY EDITOR AND REBOOT THE MACHINE TO MAKE THE CHANGES EFFECTIVE
