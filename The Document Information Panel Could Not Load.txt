THE DOCUMENT INFORMATION PANEL COULD NOT LOAD
---------------------------------------------

FOR SOME REASON THE DOCUMENT INFORMATION PANEL WILL NOT LOAD AND WILL GIVE AN ERROR MESSAGE STATING THAT, AND NOTHING ELSE.  THIS HAPPENS WHEN THE STUDENT CLICKS ON THE OFFICE BUTTON -> PREPARE -> PROPERTIES

MOST OF THE "SOLUTIONS" DEALT WITH SHAREPOINT SCENARIOS, BUT AS SHAREPOINT IS NOT BEING USED AT THE SCHOOL, THE SIMPLEST SOLUTION IS AS FOLLOWS:

START -> RUN -> CMD <ENTER>

C$:\ NET STOP SENS

CLOSE THE WINDOW
