# Introduction

This repository was created in order for me to have an easy way to keep track of all of the useful info that I come across on a daily basis working as a facilitator for Academy of Learning College's Richmond campus.

While a good deal of this information would be "obvious" to others, I decided to keep track of it for myself as some of these issues may only come up once or twice per year (or even every couple of years).

Over the course of the next month or so, files that are no longer relevant (those relating to Windows 7, or older versions of Office, for example) will get purged out of here, or moved into an archive branch so that while they might be out of sight, they can still be retrieved if necessary.
