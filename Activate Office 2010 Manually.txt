Activating Office 2010 Manually
===============================

When attempting to activate Office 2010, you receive the error message:

* An unspecified error has occurred.  Your request cannot be processed at this time. Please try again later (0x80070190) *

This assumes that  you have opened any of the Office applications and entered the correct product key from File -> Help -> Activate (2V2FK-84TQP-TTYQJ-3D8QM-W7HX2)

Activate by using OSPP.VBS
--------------------------

Open an administrative command prompt (Start -> All Programs -> Accessorires -> Right click Command Prompt and select 'Run as Administrator')

C:> CD C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14

C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14> cscript ospp.vbs /act

This should report that the activation was successful. You can then open any Office program and confirm that Office has been activated.
