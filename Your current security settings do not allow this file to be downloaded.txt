YOUR CURRENT SECURITY SETTINGS DO NOT ALLOW THIS FILE TO BE DOWNLOADED
----------------------------------------------------------------------
THIS TENDS TO BE FRUSTRATING ISSUE, AS THE FIRST TIME IT CAME UP, IT WAS BECAUSE SOMEONE WAS TRYING TO PRINT FROM CMS, AND THEY GOT THIS ERROR MESSAGE.  THE USER IS A MEMBER OF THE ADMINISTRATORS GROUP, AND IS CONFIFGURED AS AN ADMINISTRATOR IN CMS.

SOLUTION AS IS FOLLOWS:

1. OPEN INTERNET EXPLORER
2. CLICK TOOLS -> OPTIONS
3. CLICK ON THE SECURITY TAB
4. SELECT THE INTERNET ZONE
5. CLICK ON THE CUSTOM LEVEL BUTTON AND SCROLL DOWN TO DOWNLOAD
6. MAKE SURE THAT FILE DOWNLOADS IS *ENABLED*
7 CLICK APPLY AND OK

THE PRIMARY REASON THAT THIS ISSUE WAS SO FRUSTRATING, IS THAT INTERNET EXPLORER IS *NOT* CONFIGURED AS THE DEFAULT INTERNET BROWSER ON THIS MACHINE.  EVIDENTLY THOUGH, ACME USES SOME ASPECTS OF IE IN THE BACKGROUND IN ORDER TO DOWNLOAD FILES.
