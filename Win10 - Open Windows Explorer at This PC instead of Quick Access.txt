Open Windows Explorer at 'This PC' instead of Quick Access

In the new version of Windows, Explorer has a section called Quick Access, which includes your frequent folders and recent files.  Explorer defaults to opening thi spage when you open a new window.  If you'd rather open the usual "This PC", with just links to your drives and library folders, here's how:

1. Open a new Explorer window (Win+E)
2. Click View in the Ribbon
3. Click Options
4. Under the General tab, next to Open File Explorer, select "This PC"
5. Click OK
