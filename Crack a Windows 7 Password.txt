Crack a Windows 7 Password
--------------------------

Rather a simple way to get around a changed Windows password.  For example, someone changes the password, and it's the only account on the machine.

1. Boot the machine with a Windows 7 DVD (32-bit requires a 32-bit disk, and x64 requires an x64 disk)
2. Click Next (no, you're not going to install the OS...)
3. Click Repair Your Computer
4. Note the drive letter of the Recovery partition (normally this is D:).  If there is no recovery partition, simply substitute C: for D: below
5. Click on Command Prompt
6. Enter the following two commands:

	D:> copy d:\windows\system32\utilman.exe d:\
	 1 file copied.
	
	D:> copy d:\windows\system32\cmd.exe d:\windows\system32\utilman.exe
	 Overwrite existing file? (Yes/No/All): Yes
	 
7. Restart the machine and remove the DVD
8. When the machine boots up and comes up to the login screen, click on Ease of Access in the lower left hand corner, which has just been replaced with cmd.exe.  A DOS box should appear
9. Enter the following to change the password:

	net user {Username} {password}  (whatever you'd like the new password to be)

10. Close the DOS box
11. Enter the new password you've chosen as the user's password, and you should be into the machine

Adding a new user from the command line
---------------------------------------
net user username password /ADD
(for example:  net user Rod newpassword /ADD)

After creating this user, it will be necessary to reboot the machine in order to have the new account option available.  Note that this user will only be a Standard User account.  It will still be necessary to add them to the Administrators group to give those privileges to the account.
