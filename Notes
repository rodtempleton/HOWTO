Pi and Linux Notes (bash command line video is at 22 minutes)
------------------
Version 1.07.16-3

I.	General Usage
	-------------
01 How do I determine which shell is in use?
	ps -p $$
		The default shell is bash
02 How do I determine how cool the fan is keeping the Pi?
	vcgencmd measure_temp
		This will show the current temperature
	watch vcgencmd measure_temp 
		This will keep a running window that updates the current temperature every 2 seconds
03 How do I create an alias?
	alias fan="vcgencmd measure_temp"
		Instead of the full command, just enter 'fan'
04 What aliases do I have configured?
	Simply enter 'alias' (no quotes) and hit Enter. Lists all aliases
05 How do I create a file of aliases?
	pico .bash_aliases
		Enter the new alias here and save the file on exit
06 Can I relaunch .bash_aliases without having to close and re-open the SSH session?
	exec bash
		This will relaunch bash, including .bashrc and .bash_aliases
07 How do I update and upgrade my system?
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt full-upgrade 
	sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade (this will complete both in one line)
		'full-upgrade' should be used as it also picks up any dependency changes that may have been made
08 I'm running out of space on my SD card
	df -h
		This shows (in human readable form) how much space is actually left on the SD card
	sudo apt clean
		Download package (.deb) files are stored in /var/cache/apt/archives.  This will remove these to free up space
14 How do I determine what the name of a package I want to uninstall actually is?
	If trying to remove Teamviewer, for example:
	dpkg -l | grep teamviewer	(small L after the dash)
		This will list teamviewer-host which should then be removed with:
	sudo apt remove teamviewer-host
15 Update no longer completes as a repository I no longer need/use is no longer signed.  How do I remove the repository from apt-update?
	One of two things may be required:
		sudo pico /etc/apt/sources.list and remove the entry if it is listed there.  If it is NOT listed, then use the following:
			cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d
			sudo rm package_to_remove.list
16 Is there an easier way to configure a new SD card when imaging it?
	CTRL+SHIFT+X when Imager is open will allow you to preconfigure a range of options, such as enabling SSH, setting wireless
	info, disabling overscan, and setting a hostname for the Pi
17 How do I configure the Pi as easily as possible?
	sudo raspi-config will allow you to make multiple changes as long as you're able to login to the Pi
18 Is there a way to tell what other Wifi might be causing issues with my network?
	sudo apt install wavemon
	sudo wavemon
		This will show signal strength/performance reports for your wireless network. Additional info:
	F2 shows a level histogram
	F3 runs a scan window to show all available Wifi networks that the Pi is able to see (2.4 and 5GHz) along with signal strength
	and channel that the other access points are running on
19 What pages are good for troubleshooting help/advice?
	Help, resources and technical documents: https://magpi.cc/forumhelp
	Getting started: https://magpi.cc/forumgetstarted
	Boot problems: https://magpi.cc/forumbootproblems
	Common pitfalls for beginners: https://magpi.cc/forumpitfalls
	Configuration: https://magpi.cc/configuration
	Documentation: https://magpi.cc/documentation
20 How do I install a package with dpkg?
	dpkg -i name_of_the_package.deb
21 What do I need to get my wireless USB keyboard supported?
	sudo apt get install solaar
22 What's the easiest way to kill an unresponsive window
	Launch a terminal (CTRL-ALT-T) and enter xkill
	Click on offending window, which is immediately closed
23 Is there a Winamp-like clone for Pi?
	QMMP works just fine.  Hit 'U' to open a streaming URL and enter the ScanBC URL there
24 How do I use cmake?
	Unzip the source code to build and enter 'sudo mkdir build && cd build' 
	Enter 'cmake ..' - this will build the code in the directory above and put it in the build folder
	Enter 'make'
	Enter 'make install'
25 Is there a way to create a directory and then a directory inside that in one step?
	mkdir -v -p src/build
		This would create /home/{user}/src and /home/{user}/src/build
26 Can you create two directories at once?
	'mkdir bin src' would create both 'bin' and 'src' in the current directory
27 What key commands are used for 'less'
	The space key functions as PageDown, the 'b' key as 'PageUp' and 'q' quits the application
	less -N filename will display line numbers
28 Can I list the contents of any directory from anywhere else?
	'ls Documents' would list the contents of the Documents directory from anywhere in the filesystem
29 Is there an easy way to customize the themes used on my Pi?
	Use 'lxappearance' in the terminal. This is hidden by default from the main menu, but can also be enabled in the Main Menu Editor
	option from the main menu so that it's not necessary to run lxappearance each time
30 Are there any customizations for top to get more system information?
	Use 'htop' in the terminal.  This will do everthing that top does by default, and will also show the load on each of the 4 cores in the CPU


II.	Web Administration
	------------------
09 How can I install Apache on my system?
	sudo apt install apache2 -y
		Pages are stored in /var/www/html
10 I've installed Apache. How do I make changes to /var/www/html without modifying permissions each time?
	sudo usermod -a -G www-data pi (or whatever username)
	sudo chown -R -f www-data:www-data /var/www/html
		Once you've run these commands, logout and back in for changes to take effect
11 How do I install PHP?
	sudo apt install php7.3 libapache2-mod-php7.3 php7.3-mbstring php7.3-mysql php7.3-curl php7.3-gd php7.3-zip -y
12 How do I create a virtual host in Apache?
	cd /etc/apache2/sites-available
	sudo pico rod.pi.conf
		<VirtualHost *:80>
			ServerName rod.pi
			ServerAlias www.rod.pi
			DocumentRoot /var/www/rod.pi/public_html
			ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/rod.pi_error.log
			CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/rod.pi_access.log combined
		</VirtualHost>
13 Configuring static IP addresses for both eth0 and wlan0 
	sudo pico /etc/dhcpcd.conf (add to bottom of file)
		interface eth0
		static ip_address=192.168.1.25/24
		static routers=192.168.1.254
		static domain_name_servers=8.8.8.8
		
		interface wlan0
		static ip_address=192.168.1.26/24
		static routers=192.168.1.254
		static domain_name_servers=8.8.8.8
	After this, reboot the machine with 'sudo shutdown -r now' or 'sudo reboot'
