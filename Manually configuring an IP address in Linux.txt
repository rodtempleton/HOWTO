Manually configuring an IP address in Linux
-------------------------------------------

Open the interface file:
	sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces


For the primary interface, which is usually eth0, you will see these lines:
	auto eth0
	iface eth0 inet dhcp

This indicates that DHCP is currently being used.  We're going to change DHCP to static and then there are a number of options to be added. 

	auto eth0
	iface eth0 inet static
		address 192.168.1.36
		netmask 255.255.255.0
		gateway 192.168.1.254
		dns-nameservers 4.2.2.2 8.8.8.8

After this restart the interfaces, or just reboot the server
