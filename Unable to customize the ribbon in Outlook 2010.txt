UNABLE TO CUSTOMIZE RIBBON IN OUTLOOK 2010
------------------------------------------
STUDENT IS TRYING TO CUSTOMIZE THE RIBBON IN AN EXERCISE IN OTL10P2.  THE OPTION TO CUSTOMIZE THE RIBBON IS GREYED OUT, AND WHEN CLICKING ON FILE -> OPTIONS -> CUSTOMIZE RIBBON, ALL OF THE AVAILABLE CUSTOMIZATIONS HAVE BEEN REMOVED.

THIS IS THE RESULT OF OUTLOOK 2010 STARTING IN SAFE MODE, WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE STUDENT OR FACILITATOR.  THIS IS CAUSED BY ONE PARTICULAR WINDOWS UPDATE (KB3114409) WHICH IS SAFE TO REMOVE AS IT CONTAINS NO SECURITY FIXES.

RUN WINDOWS UPDATE AND FIND THE APPROPRIATE UPDATE BY KB NUMBER (IDENTIFIED SIMPLY AS UPDATE FOR OUTLOOK 2010) AND REMOVE IT.  WHEN COMPLETED, THE MACHINE WILL NEED TO BE REBOOTED.

MICROSOFT ALSO GIVES A FIX ON THEIR SUPPORT SITE, WHICH ** IS CURRENTLY INCORRECT ** BUT IS MENTIONED HERE AS IT MAY BECOME APPLICABLE IN THE FUTURE.

1. EXIT ALL MICROSOFT APPLICATIONS
2. START THE REGISTRY EDITOR
3. LOCATE AND SELECT THE FOLLOWING REGISTRY SUBKEY:
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Office\14.0\Outlook\Security
4. CREATE A NEW DWORD VALUE
5. TYPE DisableSafeMode AND HIT ENTER
6. IN THE VALUE DATA BOX FOR THIS KEY, ENTER 1 AND CLICK OK
7. EXIT THE REGISTRY EDITOR

REBOOT THE MACHINE AND PROBLEM SHOULD BE RESOLVED.

THE PROBLEM WITH THE KB ARTICLE LISTED AS ABOVE COMES FROM THE FACT THAT THERE IS NO \Security SECTION UNDER OFFICE\14.0\OUTLOOK.  THIS MAY BE ADDRESSED IN THE FUTURE, BUT FOR THE TIME BEING, SIMPLY REMOVING THE UPDATE KB3114409 WILL RESOLVE THE ISSUE.
